                        possible.<br> Another advantage of online galleries is that the art buying public is broadening but people are still somewhat intimidated by most commercial art galleries.They think <br>they know nothing about art and we believe
                        that in some cases this disadvantages the sales of some artists.If the potential buyer has access to wide range of art that they can view in the comfort and safety of their own home they will tend to look a bit deeper and get to
                        know what and who they like.<br><br></p>
